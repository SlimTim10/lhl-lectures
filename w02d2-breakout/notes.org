- Know about the fancy ES6 features and when to use them

** Strict mode
- https://johnresig.com/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
- Throws errors for some common coding mistakes
- Enabled by default in modules

** let, const
- What is the scope for var?
- What is the scope for let and const?
- How are let and const different?
- Are const variables immutable?

** for...of
- Similarity to for...in
- Arrays and strings are iterables

** Template literals
- Useful, but not a big difference

** Arrow functions
- Greatest thing since tabbed browsing (pro-tip: ctrl+shift+t)
- Difference with "this"
- Especially useful for anonymous functions and callbacks

** Promises
